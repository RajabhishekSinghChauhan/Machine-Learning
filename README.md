    •	Model Training: Implements a neural network with dropout regularization.
    •	Evaluation: Assesses model performance on validation data.
    •	Prediction: Generates predictions for a test dataset and saves results to a CSV file.
  Requirements
    •	Python
    •	Pandas
    •	NumPy
    •	scikit-learn
    •	TensorFlow
